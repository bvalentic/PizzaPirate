    <p id="theft-report">In an act of depraved cowardice, my beloved pizza was stolen from me.
            I can't bear to imagine what sick acts that lunatic has done and continues to do to my 
            pie. If you know anything about the crime that has been committed, please contact the police 
            <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=police+stolen+pizza&rlz=1C1GCEA_enUS817US817&oq=police+stolen+pizza&aqs=chrome..69i57.2455j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">
                here</a>. I will be giving a BIG CA$H REWARD to anyone who comes forward with information
            that will aid this investigation. 
            A link to reach me is also available at the bottom of this page.If you don't feel 
            comfortable talking with the federales, you can reach out to me and I'll take care of the 
            perpetrator(s) myself. Donations for a replacement pizza are appreciated, but the GoFundMe 
            page is not yet set up. Your kind words help me through this trying time. In lieu of 
            flowers, please send pizza. Thank you.
